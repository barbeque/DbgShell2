# DbgShell
This is a continuation of the work done by DavidSch on the DbgShell codeplex project.

## Fixes made
 * Better error message when `cdb.exe` cannot be found
 * Changed default settings (paths, etc) to work better with a standard Windows 10 SDK install
 * Changed default sos load command in settings
 * Reloading plugins no longer causes them to be appended to the list multiple times
